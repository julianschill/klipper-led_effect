# LED Effects for Klipper

## Description

This is the standalone repository of the Klipper LED Effects module developed by [Paul McGowan](https://github.com/mental405) with contributions from myself.
It allows Klipper to run effects and animations on addressable LEDs, such as Neopixels, WS2812 or SK6812.

See the chapter in this video from Vector3D what it can do and how to set it up (start from the beginning to learn how to connect the LEDs):
